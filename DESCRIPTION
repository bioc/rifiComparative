Description: 'rifiComparative' is a continuation of rifi package. It compares two conditions output of rifi using half-life and mRNA at time 0 segments. As an input for the segmentation, the difference between half-life of both condtions and log2FC of the mRNA at time 0 are used. The package provides segmentation, statistics, summary table, fragments visualization and some additional useful plots for further anaylsis.
