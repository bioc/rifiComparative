Description: 'rifiComparative' is an extension of the 'rifi' package. It is designed to compare the outputs of 'rifi' under two different conditions by utilizing the half-life and mRNA at time 0 segments. To perform the segmentation, it takes into account the difference in half-life between the two conditions and the log2FC (fold change) of the mRNA at time 0. This package offers various functionalities such as segmentation, statistical analysis, summary tables, visualization of fragments, and additional plots that can be helpful for further analysis.
